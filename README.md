## Be the Mindset iOS App
Mindset contains a set of videos that will that will motivate you to take action and commitment!

## Motivation
Since I watch a lot of motivational videos, they are a handful of favorite videos that I rewatch on Youtube. Instead of going to Youtube everytime I want to watch a motivational video, why not have an app that has a list of my favorite videos? So I won't have to be going to Youtube and searching for them everytime.
